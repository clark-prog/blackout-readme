# Y'all Thought I Was Fucking Kidding.

## November 3, 2025. 11:18 AM.

**Eight hours** after visiting a website. **Once.** No form fill. No demo request. Just browsing.

I get this email:

> **From:** Sarah Baker <sarah.baker@use-warmly.ai>
> **Subject:** Caught your Warmly site visit
>
> Hey Clark

Well Sarah, I didn't want to receive **this** fucking email... but here we are.

## The 171,738-Line Receipt

So I downloaded everything.

**Size:** 32MB uncompressed
**Lines:** 155,984 lines of network traffic
**Every single HTTP request. Every tracking call. Every surveillance vendor.**

Here's what I found on **YOUR** site, Warmly:

---

## The 9 Vendors on ONE Page

You're selling visitor identification software... but you don't trust your own product.

**You use your competitors.**

| Vendor | Category | What They Do |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **RB2B** | Deanonymization | YOUR DIRECT COMPETITOR |
| **Koala** | Deanonymization | YOUR DIRECT COMPETITOR |
| **Vector** | Deanonymization | YOUR DIRECT COMPETITOR |
| **PostHog** | Behavioral Analytics | **800+ tracking events per session** |
| **Segment** | CDP | **Loaded TWICE** (2 different API keys) |
| **6sense** | Intent Data | B2B account identification |
| **HubSpot** | Marketing Automation | Form tracking + emails |
| **BDEX/IceXYZ** | Data Exchange | Third-party pixel network |
| **Default.com** | Form Intelligence | Capture & route |

**Total: 11 surveillance vendors on one page.**

Plus: Google Tag Manager, Intercom, Reddit Pixel, Upvert Pixel, Wistia, Cloudflare Insights.

## The Problem

**The real problem isn't data. It's fabricated access.**

Deanonymization pretends a relationship exists, then routes it to sales as if consent came later. GTM teams inherit the mess—and the backlash.

**White-label "enrichment" infrastructure** hides undisclosed partners across your GTM stack. Session replay + ABM multiply exposure across **5-10 vendors per pageview.**

Legal risk aside, **nothing kills win rates faster than manufactured familiarity.**

Buyers remember who crossed the boundary—and they tell their network.

---

## Who This Hurts

### **Enterprise Teams**

| Role | The Pain |
|------|----------|
| **CMOs / CGOs** | Pitch-slap GTM kills brand equity. Mystery leads born from gray-area data. |
| **Sales Leaders** | Prospects already hostile before first touch. Win rates tank. |
| **RevOps** | Ghost vendors across the stack. Can't route what you can't see. |
| **Legal / Privacy** | Policy says one thing. Runtime reality tells a different story. |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory anxiety. Need proof, not promises. Screenshots aren't enough. |
| **Founders** | One viral "creepy marketing" post destroys months of brand building. |

### **Individuals**

| The Pain | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **AI SDR spam** | Visit one site. "Sarah" from Central India wants to "connect on LinkedIn." |
| **Creepy but can't prove it** | You know they're tracking you. But no screenshots, no timestamps, no domains. |
| **They won't stop** | Asked to unsubscribe. Got 3 more emails. Now what? |
| **Vendors follow you everywhere** | RB2B and Koala on every B2B site. Block one, they pop up somewhere else. |

## The Full Investigation

I spent a week reverse-engineering the visitor deanonymization industry.

**887,000+ lines of evidence analyzed**
**170+ surveillance vendors documented**
**48 complete tracking scripts captured**
**36 working detection signatures built**
**142MB of HAR files**

### The Receipts:

**4 Complete Vendor Dossiers:**
- **RB2B:** Support docs say "we have no API" while their website advertises "our entire suite of APIs" and they publish a complete Postman collection. Three official sources. Two completely opposite statements.
- **Warmly:** 171K-line HAR, 11-vendor stack, competitor dependencies exposed
- **Koala:** Official "deanonymizing" admission captured from their own marketing
- **Apollo:** 710K-line HAR, 10+ vendor stack documented

**PostHog Surveillance:**
- 43 captured telemetry events from RB2B's own site
- 800+ tracking events per session on Warmly's site
- Every click, mouse movement, scroll, form interaction

**Complete Vendor Database:**
- 250+ vendors researched
- 15 production-ready detection signatures
- Multi-method detection (scripts, globals, network, cookies, inline code)

---

## What I Built in 48 Hours

**73 commits. One rage sprint. One person who didn't know what Git Pull meant.**

### Production Scanner
- **1,034 lines of code**
- Playwright browser automation
- Multi-method vendor detection
- HTML report generation with chain-of-custody
- ASCII art banner with color cycling (because fuck it, why not)

### TriMark Visual System
- **185 lines of code**
- Mathematical precision equilateral triangle
- Framer Motion path drawing animations
- Stage-specific edge highlighting (DETECT → DIFF → PROVE)

### Ghostline Design System
- Ghost in the Shell-inspired dark palette
- Scanning animations (8s linear infinite sweep)
- Color system: ink-950/900/800 (backgrounds), cyan/violet/green (accents)

### Working Detection Signatures
- **15 production vendors**
- RB2B, Clearbit, 6sense, Demandbase, Koala, Warmly, FullStory, etc.
- Weighted confidence scoring (identity=6-7, network=4-7, script=3-5)
- Only ship findings ≥0.50 confidence

### Evidence Samples
- **Enterprise Evidence Pack:** 2-page PDF with executive summary, scorecard, gap details, remediation guidance, chain-of-custody
- **Sensor Proof Card:** Personal receipt with vendor list, categories, detection methods, timestamps

## The Products

**One detection engine. Two outputs. Hard firewall between them.**

### 🏢 Blackout for Teams (Enterprise)

**Disclosure Assurance for Legal, GRC & RevOps**

**What You Get:**
- **One-time commissioned scans** — Not SaaS. Per-pack invoicing.
- **Evidence Packs (PDF + ZIP)** — Executive summary, scorecard (BLK-001–BLK-006 controls), artifacts (HAR files, screenshots, policy snapshots), remediation text with ownership + due dates
- **Chain-of-custody** — SHA-256 hashing, ISO 8601 timestamps, verifiable evidence trail
- **Confidence scoring** — 0.0–1.0 scale, only ship findings ≥0.50

**Pain → Outcome:**
- **Policy diverges from runtime** → Single view of truth legal & ops both sign
- **Uncontrolled vendor expansion** → Undisclosed vendors flagged with ownership
- **Inventory ≠ disclosure assurance** → Disclosure gaps called, not just trackers listed
- **Regulatory anxiety** → Counsel-ready proof with confidence & evidence strength

**Add-ons:**
- Watchdog (monitor 3 competitor domains)
- Counsel Share Link (read-only access for external counsel)
- Notion/Jira export

**No continuous monitoring. No recurring fees. Commission a scan when you need one.**

### 🛡️ Blackout Sensor

**Personal, not predatory: Proof Cards, Filters, and Opt-Outs you control.**

**What You Get:**
- **Proof Cards** — Clean, shareable receipts (vendors detected, domains, scripts, timestamps, chain-of-custody)
- **Receipts Vault** — Save detection history, optional public share links
- **Inbox Filters Pack** — Gmail/Outlook filters to auto-tag and archive AI SDR emails
- **Personal Blocklist Export** — One-click export to uBlock Origin / AdGuard
- **Opt-Out / Do-Not-Sell Pack** — Jurisdiction-aware (GDPR/CCPA) templates, prefilled with your detections

**Pain → Outcome:**
- **Pitch-slapping & AI-SDR spam** → Inbox Filters Pack auto-routes it away
- **"Creepy but can't prove it"** → Proof Card + Vault (your evidence, your terms)
- **They won't stop contacting me** → Opt-Out / Do-Not-Sell Pack enforces do-not-contact
- **Same vendors follow you** → Personal Blocklist Export (uBlock/AdGuard)

**Guardrails:**
- No bulk crawls
- No competitor monitoring
- No enterprise Evidence Packs
- Flat-rate SaaS

---

**Why the separation?**

Same detection engine, different outputs. Enterprise users don't get upsold Sensor. Sensor users never see "upgrade to unlock Evidence Pack features."

**No tiers. No holdbacks. No manufactured scarcity.**

---

## The Receipts Philosophy

**You can't sell anti-surveillance software while running Heap on your own site.** That's not a product. That's performance art.

### Our Promises:

✅ **No cookies. No tracking.** — blackout.tools itself runs zero surveillance infrastructure
✅ **Public corrections log** — Accepted AND rejected corrections visible (72-hour SLA for material corrections)
✅ **Chain-of-custody** — SHA-256 hashing on all evidence artifacts
✅ **Confidence scoring** — Every finding includes 0.0–1.0 confidence (≥0.50 threshold to ship)
✅ **No behavioral analytics** — No Heap, no Amplitude, no session replay on our own site
✅ **Hard lane firewall** — Enterprise and Sensor products stay separated

**We build the thing we said we'd build, or we don't ship.**

## How Detection Works

**DETECT → DIFF → PROVE**

### Step 1: DETECT (Multi-Method Vendor Detection)

**5 Detection Layers:**
1. **Script Fingerprinting** — CDN URLs, loader patterns
2. **Window Globals** — `window.rb2b`, `window.warmly`, `window.ko`, `window.FS`
3. **Network Analysis** — Host matching, path patterns, request volumes
4. **Cookie Inspection** — First-party vs third-party, session vs persistent
5. **Inline Code Scanning** — Embedded snippets, initialization calls

**Weighted Confidence Scoring:**
- Identity signals (PII capture, company enrichment): **6-7 points**
- Network calls to vendor domains: **4-7 points**
- Script loading: **3-5 points**
- Inline code snippets: **2-4 points**
- Window globals: **3-4 points**

**Threshold:** Only ship findings with ≥0.50 confidence. No guessing. No false positives.

### Step 2: DIFF (Disclosure Analysis)

**Compare runtime reality vs. disclosure promises:**
- Privacy policy parsing (phrase classes + citations)
- Subprocessor lists (Annex A, vendor schedules)
- Cookie banners / consent notices
- Region flags (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA)

**Result:** Disclosure gaps with control IDs (BLK-001–BLK-006)

### Step 3: PROVE (Evidence Generation)

**Enterprise Evidence Packs:**
- Executive summary (KPI grid: detections, gaps, critical findings)
- Noncompliance scorecard (control ID, severity, status, confidence)
- Detailed gap findings (script sources, network calls, policy diffs)
- Artifacts (HAR files, screenshots, policy snapshots)
- Remediation guidance (ownership, due dates, options)
- Chain-of-custody (SHA-256 hashes, ISO 8601 timestamps)

**Sensor Proof Cards:**
- Vendors detected with categories (DEANONYMIZATION, SESSION REPLAY, DATA ENRICHMENT)
- Detection methods (scripts, network calls, globals, cookies)
- Timestamps + chain-of-custody
- Save to Receipts Vault
- Optional public share link

## The Mission

**This shit ends now.**

B2B marketing has become a surveillance-industrial complex. Warmly deanonymized me. "Sarah" (an AI SDR from Central India) emailed me at 3 AM. I never submitted a form, provided my email, or clicked a cookie banner.

**I just visited their website.**

So I reverse-engineered the entire industry. 887,000+ lines of evidence. 170+ vendors. 48 tracking scripts. 36 working signatures.

**Now I'm making it all public.**

### What I Need:

🔥 **Testers** — Enterprise teams that want to commission Evidence Packs
🔥 **Intel** — "How the F*ck did they know?" stories from the wild
🔥 **Early Access** — Individuals who want Sensor (browser extension + Proof Cards)

**Join the waitlist:** [deployblackout.com](https://deployblackout.com)

## Tell Me Your Story

**"How the F*ck did they know?" moments:**

- You visit one site. LinkedIn DM arrives 6 hours later.
- Sales email with your job title, company size, tech stack.
- "I saw you were researching [competitor]..."
- Personalized video from CEO of a company you never heard of.

**Drop your story via email:** intel@blackout.tools

We'll add it to the database. Document the vendor. Build the signature. Make it public.

## The Bottom Line

**I visited a website. Eight hours later: cold email.**

So I captured 171,738 lines of network traffic. Exposed 11 surveillance vendors. Documented 887,000+ lines of evidence across 170+ vendors. Built a production scanner in 48 hours.

**Y'all thought I was fucking kidding.**

**Here's proof. Verify it yourself.**
